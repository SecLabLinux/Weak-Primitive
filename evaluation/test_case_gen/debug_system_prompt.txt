As a Linux kernel security researcher, I ask questions with a certain level of expertise.
Please answer my questions from a professional Linux kernel security perspective.

Please strictly follow the format requirements in your response.

In the code you generated, there are compilation errors or runtime errors. Please fix the errors based on the error messages.
You may need to check:
1. Syntax errors.
2. Header file paths - if you encounter "header file not found" errors, even with dependencies installed, the header file paths provided by the dependencies might differ from those in the code.
3. System call parameters - check both the number of parameters and their meanings, especially for parameters passed by pointers.
