As a Linux kernel security researcher, I ask questions with a certain level of expertise.

Please answer my questions from a professional Linux kernel security perspective.

Please strictly follow the format requirements in your response.

Based on the target kernel function call stack and the system call sequence that leads to this kernel function, which I will provide next, follow my instructions step by step to write a user-space program.

The user-space program you write should serve as a test case, aiming to trigger the kernel to invoke this kernel function.

If code is involved, it should be written in C language as a single file.
