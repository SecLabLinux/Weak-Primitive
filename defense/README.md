# Shadow Heap Defense

This directory contains the implementation of a Shadow Heap defense mechanism against heap exploitation.

## Overview

The Shadow Heap defense is implemented in `./linux/mm/shadow_heap/shadow_heap.c`. It provides protection against various heap-based attacks by maintaining a shadow copy of heap metadata.

## Key Features

- Maintains a shadow copy of critical heap metadata
- Validates heap operations against the shadow copy

## Implementation Details

The defense works by:
1. Creating a protected shadow region for heap metadata
2. Validating all heap operations against the shadow copy
3. Detecting inconsistencies between actual and shadow metadata
4. Terminating the process if malicious behavior is detected

## Usage

The Shadow Heap defense is implemented as a kernel module and can be enabled system-wide or per-process.
